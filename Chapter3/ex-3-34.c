/*3.34 (Palindrome Tester) A palindrome is a number or a text phrase 
 * that reads the same backward as forward. For example, each of the 
 * following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 
 * and 11611. Write a program that reads in a five-digit integer and 
 * determines whetheror not itâ€™s a palindrome. [Hint: Use the division 
 * and remainder operators to separate the number into its 
 * individual digits.] */
